# AT3-DL-image-captioning

## Project Overview

This repository contains the implementation for **Assignment 3 - Image Captioning**, part of the Deep Learning course at UTS. The objective of this project is to build an image captioning model that takes an image as input and generates a meaningful textual description.

The model combines:
- A **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for image feature extraction
- A **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** or **LSTM** for sequence generation (captioning)

The dataset used is **Flickr8k**, consisting of 8,000 images, each annotated with five different captions.
