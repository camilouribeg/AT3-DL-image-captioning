# AT3-DL-image-captioning

This repository contains the implementation of Assignment 3 - Image Captioning for the Deep Learning course at UTS. The project involves building a custom image captioning model using PyTorch. It combines a pre-trained CNN (for image feature extraction) with an RNN/LSTM (for sequence generation) to generate natural language descriptions of images from the Flickr8k dataset

The project includes:
	•	Data preprocessing and cleaning
	•	Model architecture design and experimentation
	•	Evaluation using BLEU scores (BLEU-1 to BLEU-4)
	•	Visual analysis of generated captions
	•	Final report with findings, limitations, and recommendations
